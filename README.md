// This is a 1 week project that I made while I was bored. 
The Kawaii Name Generator or Kawaii Name Gacha! is a simple gacha game where you pull for names and recieve coins to rise 
in the ranks at the leaderboard. 

Initially, I only wanted to make a simple name generator system to learn but as an avid genshin fan, why not make a gacha system while we're at it?
